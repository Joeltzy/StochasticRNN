# Stochastic Recurrent Neural Networks With Applications To S&P500 Daily Returns Prediction

## Introduction
This repository contains an implementation of the Stochastic Recurrent Neural Network (SRNN) model described in

Sequential Neural Models with Stochastic Layers <br>
Marco Fraccaro, Søren Kaae Sønderby, Ulrich Paquet, Ole Winther <br>
NIPS 2016, arXiv preprint [arXiv:1605.07571](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07571)

The implementation is built using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) Framework. It is part of the submission for the MA4199 Honors Year Project from National University of Singapore (NUS).

## Repository Layout
* **3_Code**: SRNN and LSTM Model
* **4_Data**: Daily Financial Data of S&P500 
* **Images**: Images of various plots generated

## Running the Code
1. Download [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install) Software either using conda or pip.
2. Clone the repository by running the command below.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Joeltzy/StochasticRNN.git
```
3. Run the command ```jupyter notebook``` in Terminal after Jupyter had been installed.
4. Access the folder **3_Code** and open the file **SRNN_LSTM.ipynb** using jupyter.
5. Code can be run cell by cell.
